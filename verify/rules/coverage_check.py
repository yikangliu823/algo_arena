"""Check the Firestore emulator's rules coverage (ruleCoverage JSON) against the round-1 threshold:
every boolean condition in firestore.rules was evaluated both true and false.

Usage: python3 verify/rules/coverage_check.py firestore.rules cov1.json [cov2.json ...]
Several reports (one per test file: loading rules resets the emulator's counters) are merged by source position.
Prints every boolean expression with the values it took, then a summary. Exit 1 if any expression misses true or
false, or if an `allow ... if <expr>` line with a non-literal condition never appears in any report.
